          <h3>Project-0</h3>
          <p>Project-0 is an HTML-CSS project, so I got the assignment to make a website about something with 2 to 3 other people. I've done this project two times now and the result of the first one is visible in the image beneath this text. The first project was about planning a holiday to the place of your choice. So we came up with three different kinds of trips and with different target audiences. We would then plan the flight, accommodation and sightseeing for a couple of days. The second project was about making a website that could be used with a work out program.</p> </div>

          <p class="textcenter">For the <a href="https://www.warchild.nl">Warchild</a> project, I got the assignment to make a video in which we (me and 2 to 3 others) explain what Warchild does.
           We made this in the first year of Coderclass and we made it in the Blender animation engine. You can view the video beneath (I'm sorry for the bad quality, but as i said. It was my first year of Coderclass).</p></div>

          <h3>Philips Hue</h3>
          <p>With the Philips Hue project, we had to think of a way to use Philips Hue lamps in a practical or fun manner, and then program it like that.
          I and two friends had the idea to make a lamp that displays the battery percentage of your laptop. We made the code in Javascript and used HTML to make a website where you could use it and adjust the brightness.</p>

          <h3 class="textcenter">VR-Game</h3>
          <p class="textcenter">I together with a friend of mine decided to start working on a VR-Game in unity. We thought of this because our school had just bought two new VR/Render PC's and we thought it would be fun to make something to test them out with.
          We started with the basics, such as teleportation and being able to grab stuff. And we eventually tried to make a working gun. We are now trying to program NPC's that come after you and attack you if you come to close.</p>
